What are the available ML algorithms to test these hypotheses? Which ones are you going to choose? Why? How are they going to help you to solve/answer your questions? Which tests are you going to use to correlate the results of your experiments and your hypotheses? What happens when your tests fail? Do you have alternative hypotheses and questions?\n",
